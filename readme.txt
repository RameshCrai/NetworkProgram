Local SMTP Server Pro is a SMTP server program that can be used as a local SMTP server or
as a corporate high-performance SMTP server. It can be used along with virtually
any mailer or email program including Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora,
Netscape and The Bat, and it is ideal for laptop PC users who travel a lot and
have to use different Internet Service Providers (ISP) on the run. You can use
it instead of your ISP's SMTP server to increase your email security and privacy
due to your email messages will be delivered directly to the mailboxes of your
recipients. The email program you already use for sending and receiving messages
can be connected to the server in a very easy way - just by using the word
"localhost" instead of your current SMTP host. Having done so, you can send
messages in a usual manner. Local SMTP Server Pro is very fast and reliable, it has a
flexible protection that lets you protect the server from the outside of the
Internet, and lets you block SPAM and spammers safely. The user interface of
the program is very easy to learn, excellent documentation is included.
